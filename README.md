# Profitable-App-Profiles
Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

In this guided project, you'll work as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. The company you work at builds mobile apps and makes them available on Google Play and the App Store.

The only apps that are built are those that are free to download and install. This means the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. It also means revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use the app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. The goal of this project is to analyze data to help the developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.
